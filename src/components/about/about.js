            Felt-teachers seeks to provide inclusive, equitable and quality education to all people, globally by testing
            teachers competence in their respective fields. It aims at increase the supply of qualified teachers in
            communites with little or no availability of quality education. Teachers are made to test their experience
            on their relevant subject matter which distinguish them from others and set them for stakeholders approval
            while also serving as a sourcing tool for stake holders in need of qualified teachers in the educational
            sector.

          <p className="p-text">
            According to the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
            (UNESCO), about 13 million children and youths have not been going to school especially in regions like
            Northern Nigeria which has been affected by continous outbreak of insurgence. Since 2015, UNESCO’s regional
            response has focused on “Bridging Learning Gaps for Youth,” with gains made in increasing access to
            post-basic education, providing psycho-social support and skills, and opening up non-formal pathways to
            learning. This Solution helps implement this framework by serving as a sourcing tool for organizations like
            UNESCO to get competent teachers for communities and also serves as a tool for teachers who are willing to
            test their expertise as well as making themselves available for jobs within their communities.
